-- |Implements a family of files that acts as a single hdf5
-- file.  The purpose is to be able to split a huge file on a
-- 64-bit platform, transfer all the <2GB members to a 32-bit
-- platform, and then access the entire huge file on the 32-bit
-- platform.
--
-- All family members are logically the same size although their
-- physical sizes may vary.  The logical member size is
-- determined by looking at the physical size of the first member
-- when the file is opened.  When creating a file family, the
-- first member is created with a predefined physical size
-- (actually, this happens when the file family is flushed, and
-- can be quite time consuming on file systems that don't
-- implement holes, like nfs).
